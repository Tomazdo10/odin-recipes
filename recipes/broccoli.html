            These are the simple ingredients you'll need to make this broccoli Cheddar soup recipe:
        </h3>
        <ul>

            <li> Butter: You'll need butter to cook the onion and to make the roux.
                Flour: This broccoli Cheddar soup starts with a roux made with all-purpose flour and butter.
                Milk: A cup of milk is whisked into the roux, creating a rich and velvety soup.
                Stock: Use store-bought or homemade chicken stock.
                Vegetables: You'll need an onion, carrots, celery, and (of course) broccoli.
                Cheese: It's best to shred your own sharp Cheddar cheese, but you can use pre-shredded cheese if you
                must.
                Seasonings: The broccoli Cheddar soup is simply seasoned with salt and black pepper.
